Çíä ? Ìãáå Ñæ İÑÏÇ ÙåÑ Èå Êíã ÈÏå (ÈÑÇí Pitch):

We built an offline emergency call triage system for disaster scenarios where internet is unavailable.

It prioritizes a queue of calls (Challenge 12) using urgency scoring from speech + audio features.

It also detects speaker status and generates context-aware instructions (Challenge 15).


Every decision is explainable (keywords + scoring breakdown), which is crucial for emergency accountability
